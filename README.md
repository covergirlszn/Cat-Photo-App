fun fact, when working wth vs code you NEED to have a commit message otherwise it will mess up

search engine optimisation,, that's why you use semantic element tags to make it eaier to read
indentation makes your code cute

don't forget to image src = "nunya bloodclaart" etc
you also need to look at what a tag element and  attribute are

must i write everything on the same line?? ew

target = _blank means new tab btw

lil fyi for html
<!--okay so tags, attributes, elements and stuff. 
        
            from my understanding an element is your standard tag thing. an attribute is the attribute of the tag
            aka the element
            the attribute has a value.

            so it's a bit like in OOP, you have your object (element)
            then the object has states and methods.
            the states would be the attributes and then those states have values

            por ejemplo - bratzdoll object
            bratzDoll Sasha = new BratzDoll (17)
                vs html
            <bratzDoll age="17"> Sasha </bratzDoll>
            the age is the attribute, but the value is 17, and the element is bratzDoll
        -->

AND THEN various attributes regarding input

name= the name of the value being input so when the receiving page (see url in action) needs to view the value it can call it by name
placeholder: your standard insert text here type thing

required: this ensures the user can't leave the input sector blank, very useful for emails and contact stuff
