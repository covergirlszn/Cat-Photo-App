fun fact, when working wth vs code you NEED to have a commit message otherwise it will mess up

search engine optimisation,, that's why you use semantic element tags to make it eaier to read
indentation makes your code cute

don't forget to image src = "nunya bloodclaart" etc
you also need to look at what a tag element and  attribute are

must i write everything on the same line?? ew

target = _blank means new tab btw

lil fyi for html


            por ejemplo - bratzdoll object
            bratzDoll Sasha = new BratzDoll (17)
                vs html
            <bratzDoll age="17"> Sasha </bratzDoll>
            the age is the attribute, but the value is 17, and the element is bratzDoll
